My name is Cartland Zhou, and I am a Political Science Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). My core research seeks to model and answer questions regarding conflict initiation and dynamics as a result of great power politics and arms transfers. I also have research interests in computer vision to develop novel techniques that supplement my core research, such as optical character and object recognition.
My dissertation project is a series of papers exploring the relationship of power perceptions, arms transfers, and conflict initiation. I study the mechanisms under which major arms suppliers influence conflict dynamics.
